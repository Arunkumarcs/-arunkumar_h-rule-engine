☐ 🚀 Advanced Feature Ideas
    ☐ Rule Grouping & Namespacing
        ☐ Group rules under namespaces (e.g., "billing.*", "access-control.admin")
        ☐ Enable/disable entire groups
        ☐ Useful for toggling feature-specific logic
    ☐ Rule Inheritance & Composition
        ☐ Let rules extend other rules with overrides
    ☐ Rule Versioning
        ☐ Allow versioned rules (v1, v2, etc.)
        ☐ Useful in production environments for A/B testing and audits

☐ 🧩 Extensibility & Dev Experience
    ☐ Plugin System
        ☐ Register lifecycle hooks or custom DSLs
        ☐ Example use case: auto-load rules from DB, encrypt sensitive facts, etc.
    ☐ Built-in Rule Validators
        ☐ Validate for:
            ☐ Missing facts
            ☐ Circular dependencies
            ☐ Invalid operators
            ☐ Could throw or warn in dev mode
    ☐ Rule Engine as Middleware
        ☐ Express / Fastify middleware:
            ☐ app.use(ruleEngine.middleware({ rules }))
            ☐ Great for access control, rate limits, etc.

☐ Rule Store Modules
    ☐ Plugins for loading rules from:
        ☐ Filesystem
        ☐ Redis / MongoDB
        ☐ HTTP APIs
    ☐ Visual Rule Editor
        ☐ UI tool to edit rule conditions
        ☐ Could export as JSON/TS
        ☐ Could integrate with Docusaurus site you're working on
